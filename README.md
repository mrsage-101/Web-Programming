I took this elective intending to train myself to become proficient in coding. So, decided to do a crash course before taking my first class of web at university. I followed a YouTube video titled: [HTML & CSS Full Course - Beginner to Pro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3e-cpL7ofc).

### Technologies Covered:
